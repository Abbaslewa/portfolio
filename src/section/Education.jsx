            My education journey began with a passion for learning and a drive to acquire skills that could positively impact
            my community. From early school days in Sudan to professional training in Rwanda, I have always sought out
            opportunities to grow and improve.

            Whether it was participating in development programs, attending training seminars, or gaining technical expertise,
            each experience has shaped me into the person I am todayâ€”a software developer with a commitment to continuous learning
            and personal growth.
